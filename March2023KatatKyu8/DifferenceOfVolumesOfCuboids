// In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

// For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

// Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

// If you can, try writing it in one line of code.


//RAW CODE 
// function findDifference(a, b) {
// let arr1 = a.reduce((a,c)=>a*c,1)
// let arr2 = b.reduce((a,c)=>a*c,1)
// return arr1 > arr2 ? arr1 - arr2 : arr2 - arr1
// }

//REVAMPED
const findDifference = (a,b) => {let x = a.reduce((a,c)=>a*c,1); let y = b.reduce((a,c)=>a*c,1); return x > y ? x-y : y-x}
